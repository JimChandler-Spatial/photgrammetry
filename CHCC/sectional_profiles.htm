<h2>Sectional profiles</h2>
<p>Below is an animation which demonstrates change that has occurred within a
section or plane that cuts
through the landslide from the cliff top down to the sea (<a href="#Loc">Plane
location</a>). The surfaces used
include: 1946, 1958, 1969, 1976, 1988, 2001, approximately every 10 years. <img border="0" src="Animations/bvenMovieSection.gif" width="1138" height="460"></p>
<p><font size="2">(<i>Note that the line representing the 1946
epoch is &quot;dashed&quot; because the quality of data is lower than other
periods</i>).</font></p>
<p>See how recession of the cliff edge (or rear scarp) progresses at a rate
exceeding 1 metre per year, with some substantial variation through time. Also
how pulses of mud have spewed out onto the beach and into the sea, only to be
eroded and cut back by coastal processes.</p>
