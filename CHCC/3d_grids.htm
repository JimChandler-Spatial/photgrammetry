<h2>3D Grids</h2>
<p>The animation below attempts to provide a &quot;birds-eye&quot; view of
changes that have occurred between 1958 to 1995. The display powerfully conveys
the expansion of the westward bowl or embayment (located immediately below the
term &quot;Black&quot;) from a comparatively small feature in 1958 to the huge
scarp that is evident today. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="Animations/bvenMovieGrids.gif" width="1280" height="900"></p>
<p>This animation was derived from data mainly generated in the late 1980's
using imagery originally acquired in <a href="Datasets.htm">1958, 1969, 1976,
1988</a> and using techniques that were &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; at the
time. Although dated, this method of presentation remains effective, hence its
inclusion. The &quot;lines&quot; are actually a series of profiles cut regularly
through the landslide in an east-west direction and at an interval of 20 metres.
The birds eye view is then created by viewing these data isometrically in a 3D
Computer Aided Design (CAD) system. The method is weakened because no
contextural data is contained and the density of surface information is
comparatively low. The approach was repeated in <a href="Datasets.htm">1995</a>
using the epoch acquired in March of that year, but has not been used recently.</p>
