<h2>Surface Change</h2>
<p>This animation is difficult to comprehend but once understood certainly
demonstrates the value of deriving surface models at each epoch. Each page in
the animation is a &quot;surface of difference&quot; between two epochs and is
derived by subtracting the surface at the later epoch from the surface model
representing
the earlier point in time. Areas experiencing net erosion are negative and
coloured red, areas receiving additional material over the time difference are
positive and coloured green. Areas with no net change (though not necessarily
inactive!) are coloured white. </p>

<p>This display demonstrates vividly the major episodes of rapid cliff
recession, the whole cliff between 1958 to 1976, the central/western area
between 1976 and 1995; then a period of stability between 1995-1998 before the
major new reactivation in a new area of the cliff to the west in January 2001.
Since 2001 the site has been more stable.&nbsp; Associated change in the seaward extending lobes, 
which tend to oscillate, are also illustrated and
quantified.</p>
