<h2>Surface models</h2>

<p>This animation is derived from thousands of surface points measured at each
epoch and processed to form a series of &quot;shaded relief&quot; models. These
data were acquired by automated <a href="Data_derivation.htm#Digital photogrammetry">digital
photogrammetry</a> (<a href="Datasets.htm">1976, 1995, 2000, 2001-July</a>) and
by <a href="Data_derivation.htm#Airborne laser scanning">air-borne laser
scanning</a> (<a href="Datasets.htm">1998, 2001- May</a>). </p>

<p>The highest quality surface model was derived in 1995 at a resolution of 1m,
all other datasets are at a more coarse resolution of 2m and therefore look a
little more blurred. This is most apparent in the excellent depiction of the
deep stream gully down the middle of the left-hand lobe.</p>
