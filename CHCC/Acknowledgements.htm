research illustrated has been carried out by Dr Chandler, originally at City
University but more recently Loughborough University, where he was formerly
employed as a University Lecturer/Professor. Aerial photography and spatial data has been
acquired from many sources including: Cambridge Committee of Aerial Photography;
Natural Environmental Research Council; the Environment Agency; the Ordnance
Survey and Getmapping PLC. The author also acknowledges the supervision and advice provided by
Prof. Mike Cooper and Prof. Denys Brunsden, initially between 1986-1989 but also
subsequently. For further information regarding this project and related research,
please contact Dr J. Chandler at Loughborough University.<O:P>
