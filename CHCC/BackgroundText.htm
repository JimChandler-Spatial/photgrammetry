</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The area west of the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre
is known as Black Ven, and is not just a source of fossils and diverse plants.
It is also a site that has undergone <b>massive physical change</b> over the
last 50 years, including 80 metres of cliff recession- virtually the length of a
football pitch!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">These changes are due to the underlying unstable
geology and rain that has created the largest coastal mudslide complex in
Europe. Three massive <b>mudslide systems</b> have transported thousands of
cubic metres of rock, mud (and fossils) onto the beach, which has then been
transported along the coast, eventually contributing to Chesil beach.
Occasionally these events have been cataclysmic with large rotational failures
removing large sections of the cliff within seconds. More gradually, but equally
dramatically, rivers of rock and quick-sand literally flow down the cliff in the
wet winter months, forming huge lobes of mud which penetrate the sea.<span style="display:none;mso-hide:all">recession</span>

<h3><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Historical aerial
photography and photogrammetry <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The timing and extent of change on Black Ven has been
measured using historic aerial photographs and photogrammetry, a technique used
by the Ordnance Survey for the production of maps. Historical aerial photographs
present a unique and under utilised resource for detecting change within the
landscape and the technical difficulties of using such material were resolved in
a research project carried out in the late 1980’s. Developments in
photogrammetry since then, allow very dense spatial data to be acquired (1m
resolution) in the form of digital elevation models, (Figure A). It is also
possible to generate ortho-photographs which appear to look like the original
aerial photograph but are actually maps (background figure B). Spatial data
representing the site at different epochs since 1946 include: 1958, 1969, 1976,
1988, 1995, 2000 and 2001. Using this material it has been possible to quantify
the changes that have occurred. The main plot illustrates massive cliff top
recession and the varying position of the coastline during the last fifty years.
The inset profile (Figure C) also shows the changes within a single vertical
plane. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;

have occurred on Black Ven, which you are encouraged to view either on the
adjacent interactive display or later via the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre
website (<a href="http://www.charmouth.org/">www.charmouth.org</a>). These allow
the dramatic changes to be visualised in a novel way and it is equally
surprising to detect adjacent areas exhibiting both stability and instability!<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The
research illustrated has been carried out by Dr Chandler, originally at City
University but more recently Loughborough University, where he is currently
employed as a University Lecturer. Aerial photography and spatial data has been
acquired from many sources including: Cambridge Committee of Aerial Photography;
Natural Environmental Research Council; the Environment Agency; and the Ordnance
Survey. The author also acknowledges the supervision and advice provided by
Prof. Mike Cooper and Prof. Denys Brunsden, initially between 1986-1989 but also
subsequently. For further information regarding this and related research,
