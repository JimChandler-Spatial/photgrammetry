<h3>What is an orthophotograph?</h3>
<p>An orthophotograph, or &quot;photo-map&quot; has the spectral qualities of a photograph but the spatial
attributes of a map.&nbsp; Orthophotographs therefore may look simply like an
aerial photograph but directions, dimensions and plan positions can be all
scaled from them, which makes them far more useful! One of the disadvantages
with maps is that are a simplified representation of reality and have been
derived for a particular purpose and scale. An orthophotograph contains all
visible information without this simplifying abstracting process removing
potentially useful information. The level of detail contained is controlled
effectively by the scale of the original aerial photography and the resolution
of the scanning process. The example below illustrates both the density of
detail contained and contains a grid, signifying that it is effectively a map!<img border="0" src="images/ortho2001.jpg" width="2999" height="2321"> </p>
<p>Orthophotographs are derived using using established photogrammetric methods
where distortions dues to relief (i.e. topography) and tilt (i.e. camera wasn't
perfectly vertical during original photo acquisition) in the original aerial
photograph are removed.</p>
