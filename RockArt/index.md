**Rock-art and Heritage recording**
In 2005, Jim spent 6 months on study leave at the University of Newcastle, Australia. He was working in conjunction with Prof. John Fryer to develop the use of cheap digital cameras to record aboriginal rock art, both [pictographs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCmrG3YShI) and ![petroglyphs](https://github.com/JimChandler-Spatial/photogrammetry/blob/gh-pages/Images/baime_jc.jpg). The project was funded by The British Academy and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The Australian work has been published fully at a [CIPA Congress](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Fryer2/publication/28576608_Recording_aboriginal_rock_art_using_cheap_digital_cameras_and_digital_photogrammetry/links/0deec52cf2144cd7a3000000/Recording-aboriginal-rock-art-using-cheap-digital-cameras-and-digital-photogrammetry.pdf), in Rock Art Research and the [Photogrammetric Record](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1477-9730.2007.00414.x).

In 2005, Chandlerâ€™s rock art recording techniques were applied in the UK on the [Northumberland and Durham Rock Art Recording Project](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/era/section/record_manage/rm_projects_nadrap_home.jsf), through a collaboration with English Heritage. Seven Nikon Coolpix 5400 cameras were acquired in calibrated at Loughborough and volunteers systematically acquired data representing 2000 Neolithic rock-art motifs in the northeast of England. 

More recently, some of the original imagery has been reprocessed and the 3-D models have been made more widely available via the 3D viewing portal and repository [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/cvjhc/collections/aboriginal-rock-art)
