**ISPRS Working group V6 (2008-12) and V5 (2012-16) and Tips for effective use of digital close range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning**

One of the successful outputs from working group V6 was to develop and make freely available ‘best-practice’ guidelines for non-expert users of:

1. [Close range digital photogrammetry](https://github.com/JimChandler-Spatial/photogrammetry/blob/gh-pages/OtherFiles/photogrammetry-tips.pdf) (updated, September 2010);

2. [Terrestrial laser scanners](https://github.com/JimChandler-Spatial/photogrammetry/blob/gh-pages/OtherFiles/laser_scanning-tips.pdf).

Note that the original Working Group websites currently remain accessible courtesy of my former employer: 
[**ISPRS V6**](http://isprsv6.lboro.ac.uk/) and 
[**ISPRS V5**](http://isprsv5.lboro.ac.uk/).
