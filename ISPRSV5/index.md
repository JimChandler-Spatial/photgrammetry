**ISPRS Working group V6 (2008-12) and V5 (2012-16) and Tips for effective use of digital close range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning**

One of the successful outputs from working group V6 was to develop and make freely available ‘best-practice’ guidelines for non-expert users of:

1. Close range digital photogrammetry (updated, September 2010);

2. Terrestrial laser scanners.
